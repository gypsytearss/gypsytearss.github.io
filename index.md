I'm a 29-year old data scientist and software developer originally from northern California. For the past few years I've been working on research problems in applied machine learning and robotics as a member of the [Pracsys Lab](http://www.pracsyslab.org/) at [Rutgers University](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/). I will defend my master's thesis in summer 2017, which focuses on the adaptation of Bayesian optimization methods to develop gait libraries for high-dimensional, physically-simulated robotic systems in a sample-efficient way. 

Before that, I worked on developing asset valuation models and database infrastructures for [RPX corporation](http://www.rpxcorp.com/), a patent risk analysis firm in San Francisco, CA.
