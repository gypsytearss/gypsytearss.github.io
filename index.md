> "I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and refine your thoughts about a given topic. " -Tom Preston (creator of Jekyll), [Blogging Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)

I'm a 29-year old data scientist and software developer currently living in central New Jersey. For the past few years I've been working on research problems in applied machine learning and robotics as a member of the [Pracsys Lab](http://www.pracsyslab.org/) at [Rutgers University](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/). 
	
As a result of this work, I will defend my master's thesis in summer 2017, which focuses on the adaptation of Bayesian optimization methods to develop gait libraries for high-dimensional, physically-simulated robotic systems in a sample-efficient way. 

Before that, I worked on developing asset valuation models and database infrastructures for [RPX corporation](http://www.rpxcorp.com/), a patent risk analysis firm in San Francisco, CA.
